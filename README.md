# Real-Time Data Acquisition and Monitoring System for Automobiles

## Project Overview
This project aims to design and develop a system that collects real-time data from various sensors in automobiles, such as vehicle speed, engine temperature, fuel level, and tire pressure. The system continuously monitors these parameters and alerts drivers or service centers about anomalies or critical conditions, improving vehicle safety and performance optimization.

## Features
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Displays vehicle data such as speed, temperature, and fuel level on a dashboard.
- **Alert System:** Sends notifications and alerts when critical thresholds are breached (e.g., high temperature).
- **Data Collection:** Gathers sensor data using microcontrollers and transmits it to a user-friendly dashboard for visualization.
- **Predictive Maintenance:** Provides insights into vehicle health, enabling predictive maintenance to improve longevity and performance.

## System Components
- **Microcontroller:** STM32 NUCLEO
- **Sensors:**
  - Temperature Sensor (DHT11)
  - Fuel Level Sensor
  - Hall Effect Sensor (LM393)
  - Brake System (Tactile Push Button Switch)
- **Communication Protocol:** Data is transmitted using USB communication and processed with Python.

## Software Design
The software includes a Python-based GUI for real-time data visualization and alert management. The GUI is built using the Tkinter library, and serial communication with the STM32 microcontroller is established using PySerial.

- **Main Functions:**
  - Dashboard with real-time vehicle data (speed, RPM, temperature, fuel level).
  - Alerts and warnings based on critical thresholds (e.g., high engine temperature).
  - Data processing and visualization.
  
- **Code Overview:**
  - Python: `dashboard.py` handles real-time data visualization.
  - STM32 Code: Manages sensor data acquisition and communication.

## Hardware Design
The hardware setup includes:
- STM32 Nucleo microcontroller.
- DHT11 for temperature measurement.
- A hall-effect sensor for speed/RPM measurement.
- Fuel level sensor.
- Tactile push button switch for brake status detection.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-auto-monitoring.git
   cd real-time-auto-monitoring
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install Python and the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pyserial tkinter
   ```

3. **Run the Dashboard:**
   Connect the STM32 NUCLEO board and run the Python GUI.
   ```bash
   python dashboard.py
   ```

4. **Connect the Hardware:**
   Ensure all sensors are connected to the microcontroller as per the hardware design.

## Project Plan
The project was completed in multiple phases:
1. Market research and defining the problem statement.
2. Finalizing business and component requirements.
3. Implementation and testing at the component level.
4. Full system integration and testing.
5. Documentation and presentation.

## Test Cases
The system was tested against several parameters, including:
- **Temperature Sensor:** Testing with input temperature data (e.g., 40°C).
- **Fuel Level Detection:** Validating accurate readings from the fuel sensor.
- **Speed and RPM Monitoring:** Checking the real-time speed and RPM from the hall-effect sensor.
- **Brakes Status Reporting:** Ensuring proper brake system monitoring.
